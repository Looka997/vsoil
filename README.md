# VSOil

A small VS Code extension inspired by [oil.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim).

It lets you browse folders in a virtual `vsoil://` buffer, and stage file operations like rename, delete, move, and copy. Changes are only applied when you run an **Apply Operations** command.

## Overview

- Open folders in a text buffer
- Stage rename, delete, move, and copy operations
- Apply all changes at once
